      <h3>1. The Brandenburg Gate</h3>
      <p>
        Berlin's most famous historic landmark is the Brandenburg Gate
        (Brandenburger Tor), once a symbol of a divided nation and now a symbol
        of unity and peace.
      </p>

      <h3>2. The Rebuilt Reichstag</h3>
      <p>
        The Reichstag (Reichstagsgeb√§ude) was originally completed in 1894 where
        the Neo-Renaissance palace served as the home of the German Empire's
        Imperial Diet until it burned in 1933.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Museum Island</h3>
      <p>
        Sandwiched between the River Spree and the Kupfergraben in a
        400-meter-long canal, Spree Island is better known as Museum Island
        (Museumsinsel), a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Berlin Wall Memorial</h3>
      <p>
        The Berlin Wall originated in 1961 when East Germany sealed off that
        half of the city to prevent citizens from fleeing to West Germany. By
        the time it was torn down in 1989, the four-meter-high wall extended 155
        kilometers, dissected 55 streets, and possessed 293 observation towers
        and 57 bunkers.
